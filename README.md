# Astronomy-Astrophysics-Lab-Reports
In 2023, I took a lab class at Georgia Tech taught by Dr. Sowell. In this class, we covered many topics and wrote lab reports to discuss and analyze the findings.

In general, Dr. Sowell did an amazing job emphasizing important points that we have learned about from a previous class of his - Stars, Galaxy, and the Universe. Per the syllabus for this course, the objectives are: 
the student to acquire a working knowledge of astronomical and astrophysical data reduction and analysis, especially regarding (a) CCD photometry and spectroscopy, 
(b) coordinate systems, (c) time keeping, and (d) relevant topics such as light curves of eclipsing binaries and of exoplanet transits, stellar types and galactic structure, 
dark matter and rotation curves, and the Hubble Law. There is also an emphasis on operating telescopes, performing astrophotography, and acquiring data with the Observatoryâ€™s
campus and Maui telescopes.

In this class, we have downloaded different software in order to maximially utilize and garner data from astronomical and astrophysical images. For example, many of these labs
involved using AstroImageJ, which I have grown very comfortable with.
I have additionally already felt comfortable with LaTeX, but my skills have improved with these reports. Additionally, at first we were encouraged to not utilize python or other languages
to understand the manual plight of original astronomers, but after the first few labs, efficiency became encouraged and extremely useful. I have also been more comfortable with large data,
excel, python - specifically the pandas library and other useful imports, matlab, and more. Though these are limited in the results and don't entirely encompass the work I've put into,
I am happy to answer questions or share more of the data/code/etc. that went into this upon request - but for respect of Dr. Sowell and this class he is developing, I do not want to publicly post any more information
that could encourage future students to not put in their own hard work to get the most out of this class.

Additionally, I have included a separate work from Dr. Sowell's previous class - one of my favorite projects I've had in the entire four years I have spent at Georgia Tech. This is one of my first attempts at great science communication and working with data, and I am so happy to share it.
